                <h2>Run Machine of India</h2>
                <p><b>Virat Kohli</b>, born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, is one of the most prominent and
                    accomplished cricketers of his generation. Widely regarded as one of the finest batsmen in the
                    world, Kohli has consistently showcased his extraordinary skills and passion for the game. His
                    cricketing journey began at a young age, and he quickly rose through the ranks, making his debut for
                    the Indian national team in August 2008 during an ODI against Sri Lanka. Kohli's meteoric rise in
                    international cricket was marked by his exceptional batting prowess, remarkable consistency, and an
                    unwavering commitment to excellence.
